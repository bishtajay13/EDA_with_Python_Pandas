# EDA_with_Python_Pandas

In this project, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis utilizing Pandas. I employed Seaborn to extract and present insights, such as the comparison between male and female athletes participating in different marathon types (50 kilometers or 50 miles), the average best and worst speeds of athletes within specific age groups, and the season in which a higher number of athletes participate in marathons.
